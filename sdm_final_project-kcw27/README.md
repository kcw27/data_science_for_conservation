## Predicting the future spread of invasive *Callinectes sapidus* in European waters

### Project description

Callinectes sapidus, the Atlantic blue crab, is an invasive species in European waters whose spread may be augmented by climate change. Its expansion and proliferation are mainly limited by temperature and salinity (Mancinelli et al. 2017). These two factors are most relevant in cold seasons, when C. sapidus draws upon its stored energy reserves to survive the hibernation-like process of overwintering (Bauer and Miller 2010; Glandon et al. 2019). The colder the winter, the more likely it is that C. sapidus will deplete their energy reserves and die from starvation (Bauer and Miller 2010). At low temperatures, low salinity compounds the overwintering mortality of C. sapidus, as osmoregulation is metabolically expensive and imposes additional demand on energetic stores (Bauer and Miller 2010). This results in breakdown of osmoregulation in extreme cold, and therefore in lethal ion imbalances (Bauer and Miller 2010). It follows that if waters warm and increase in salinity, the range of C. sapidus will increase.

In order to address the question of how climate change will affect the range of C. sapidus, occurrence data and benthic raster data on lowest average temperature and salinity were used to create a Random Forest model. This model was then used to map regions of high suitability for C. sapidus in the Mediterranean Sea for the present and projected future (2040-2050) climate conditions.


### File organization

Both scripts (data_processing.Rmd and species_distribution_modeling.Rmd) are stored in the main directory. Raster files generated by running species_distribution_modeling.Rmd are stored in the figures folder. The data and processed_data folders, which are inputs to data_processing.Rmd, are hidden.


### Getting started

* Cloning the repository: Start a new project using this link https://github.com/hmc-spring2023-bio185e/sdm_final_project-kcw27.git

* Accessing data: Species occurrence data and environmental data can be downloaded from GBIF.org and Bio-ORACLE, as cited below. Additional details on what data files were used can be found in data_processing.Rmd.

* Setting up data folders: Download the species occurrence data and environmental data to a folder named "data", The processed_data folder will be automatically generated by running data_processing.Rmd, and the figures folder will be automatically generated by running species_distribution_modeling.Rmd.

* Running the scripts: Run data_processing.Rmd first in order to generate the processed data that is used in species_distribution_modeling.Rmd to generate the model and maps. Files in the data folder are inputs to data_processing.Rmd, whose outputs are saved to the processed_data folder. Files in the processed_data folder are inputs to species_distribution_modeling.Rmd, whose outputs are saved to the figures folder.
